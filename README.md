# Hawk
Hawk Anticheat ver. 1808 PRE

Outdated build: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/hawk-anticheat-mc-1-7-10-1-8-x.40343/

Although Hawk is moving out of its beta stage, there is still work to be done in the utilites. This should NOT be used in production. First official build will be ready at September 15.

Hawk is a Spigot server anticheat plugin designed to detect and prevent abuse of the Minecraft protocol. Hawk does not require any dependencies, since it relies on Spigot, Netty, and NMS code. Hawk runs on Spigot/PaperSpigot 1.7_R4 or 1.8_R3 servers.

Unfortunately, because of CraftBukkit's DMCA takedown, this is not a Maven project. If you wish to compile this, you must have Spigot (or other derivatives) servers 1.7_R4 and 1.8_R3 as build dependencies.

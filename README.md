# Hawk
Hawk Anticheat ver. BETA 1902.4

> Although Hawk is moving out of its beta stage, there are still false-positives, bypasses, and performance issues to fix. This should NOT be used in production.

Hawk is a Spigot server anticheat plugin designed to detect and prevent abuse of the Minecraft protocol. Hawk does not require any dependencies, since it relies on Spigot, Netty, and NMS code. Hawk runs on Spigot/PaperSpigot 1.7_R4 and 1.8_R3 servers.

Unfortunately, because of CraftBukkit's DMCA takedown, this is not a Maven project. If you wish to compile this, you must have Spigot (or other derivatives) servers 1.7_R4 and 1.8_R3 as build dependencies.

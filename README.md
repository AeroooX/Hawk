# Hawk
Hawk Anti-Cheat ver. 1807 PRE

Although Hawk is moving out of its beta stage, there is still work to be done in the utilites. This should NOT be used in production.

Hawk is a Spigot server anti-cheat plugin designed to prevent and detect abuse of the Minecraft protocol. Hawk does not require any dependencies, since it relies on Spigot, Netty, and NMS code. Hawk runs on Spigot/PaperSpigot 1.7_R4 or 1.8_R3 servers.

This is not a Maven project. If you wish to compile this, you must have Spigot (or other derivatives) servers 1.7_R4 and 1.8_R3 as build dependencies.
